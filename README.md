## 6 Degrees of Freedom Motion Simulator

This project aims to create a **6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) Motion Simulator**, which can control and simulate movement in all six axes: X, Y, Z, roll (Φ), pitch (θ), and yaw (ψ).

The simulator will allow precise control over each degree of freedom using sliders, with the possibility of real-time hardware interaction (e.g., Arduino) to bring the simulation to life.

## Features (Planned)
- Control over six axes using a graphical interface.
- Real-time feedback with hardware (Arduino).
- Easy-to-understand UI for controlling movement.

## Status
The project is under development. I will be updating the repository soon with more code and documentation. Stay tuned!

### Current parts of the project being worked on:
- X-Plane Flight simulator integration
- Hardware prototype is being put together to test the code
- Servo control


## Installation and Usage
Instructions for installation and usage will be provided in future updates.
